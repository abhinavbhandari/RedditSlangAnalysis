<h1> Affinity Analysis Algorithms </h1>

This repository contains the package and code used for research in the paper "Community Characteristics and Semantic Shift of High Affinity Terms in Reddit Communities". The research project consited of computing affinity values, semantic shifts and community characteristics for Reddit communities from a selected corpus. The code for this is specifically in the affinity_algorithms package. 


<h3>Project Structure </h3>
The project contains scripts that were explicitly used for the Network Dynamics Lab servers to process Reddit Datasets, as well as a package that can be used independently to the data structure
<ul>
    <li><code> affinity_analysis </code> package is an independent package that consists of exact affinity analysis, semantic shifts and community characteristics algorithms as defined in the paper.</li>
    <li><code> docs </code> contains the documentation for the package. <i> TODO </i> </li>
    <li><code> ndl </code> contains scripts specific to the Network Dynamics Lab server-side data processing. </li>
    <li><code> examples </code> contains an example notebook that demonstrates use cases of the package </li>
    <li><code> tests </code> </li>
</ul>
